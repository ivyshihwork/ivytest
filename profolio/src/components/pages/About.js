          <h1>About Me</h1>
            <br></br>
            <p>I was born in <a href="https://www.taiwan.gov.tw">Taiwan</a>.  I immigranted to the US with family when I was 16.  After attending <a href="https://fremontunified.org/washington/">Washington High School</a>in <a href="https://www.fremont.gov">Fremont, CA</a>for 2 years, I attended <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu">UC Berkeley</a>and graduated with a B.A. degree in <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/research/areas/applied-mathematics">Applied Mathematics</a>with emphasis in Statistics. </p>
            <br></br>
            <p> I have been working in various engineering positions in high tech companies.  Changes keep me learning and entertained.  Most important of all, I get to learn different perspectives of business in the process.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>I have a lot of hobbies, listing from the earliest to latest:</p>
              <br></br>
              <ul>
                <li>Yarn Works: I am working on a tablecloth that will take 3-4 balls of 1000m yarn.  I am on the second ball!</li>
                <li>Gaming:  I use it for stress relif and short breaks.  I used to be super competive and ranked.  Now only for fun.</li>
                <li>Travelling:  When I have money to afford, I like to go and see the world.</li>
                <li>Cooking: I love cooking and good at it.  During past year of work break I have made something new weekly and post photos/recipes on Facebook.</li>
              </ul>   
              <br></br>
            <p>Life is good in <a href="https://sfgov.org/visitors">San Francisco Bay Area</a>.  I enjoy the weather, food and multi-culture here.  </p>
